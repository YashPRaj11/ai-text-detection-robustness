"On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, starting the largest and deadliest war in Europe since World War II. It is a major escalation of the war between the two countries that began when Russia attacked Ukraine in 2014.[14][15][16] The fighting has caused hundreds of thousands of military casualties and tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties. As of February 2026, Russian troops occupy almost 20% of Ukraine.[17] From a population of 41 million, about 8 million Ukrainians have been internally displaced[18] and 6–7 million have fled the country,[19] creating Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II."
"In late 2021, Russia massed troops near Ukraine's borders and issued demands to the West, including a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO.[20][21] After repeatedly denying having plans to attack Ukraine, on 24 February 2022, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation"", saying that it was to support the Russian-backed breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose paramilitary forces had been fighting Ukraine in the Donbas War since 2014. Putin espoused irredentist and imperialist views challenging Ukraine's legitimacy as a state, baselessly claimed that the Ukrainian government were neo-Nazis committing genocide against the Russian minority in the Donbas, and said that Russia's goal was to ""demilitarise and denazify"" Ukraine.[d] Russian air strikes and a ground invasion were launched on a northern front from Belarus towards the capital Kyiv, a southern front from occupied Crimea, and an eastern front from the Donbas towards Kharkiv. Ukraine enacted martial law, ordered a general mobilisation, and severed diplomatic relations with Russia."

It was founded in 1985, in Southwest Detroit, by brothers Demetrius Edward ""Big Meech"" and Terry Lee ""Southwest Tee"" Flenory. By 2000, it had established cocaine distribution sales throughout the United States through its Los Angeles–based drug source and direct links to Mexican drug cartels.[8][9] The Black Mafia Family operated from two main hubs: one in Atlanta for distribution, run by Demetrius Flenory; and one in Los Angeles to handle incoming shipments from Mexico, run by Terry Flenory.[10]"
"The Black Mafia Family under Demetrius Flenory entered the hip-hop music business as BMF Entertainment in the early 2000s as a front organization to launder money from cocaine sales and to legitimize itself. BMF Entertainment served as a promoter for several high-profile hip-hop artists, and as a record label for their sole artist Bleu DaVinci. Demetrius Flenory and the Black Mafia Family became famous in hip-hop culture for their highly extravagant lifestyles."

"Air Shows took place at Naval Air Station Brunswick on random years throughout the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s organized by the United States Navy and featuring dozens of military and civilian aerial performers. The 33rd Annual Great State of Maine Air Show which took place in 2008 was expected to be the last, as Brunswick was expected to be closed by the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure process.[1] A record number of 150,000 people showed up for the two-day event.[2] The Base was officially decommissioned on 31 May 2011 with an onsite ceremony. On the same year it was announced that the Great State of Maine Air Show would return to the skies of Brunswick on August 26 and 27 of 2011, It would be organized and put-up by an all-volunteer base without the participation from the US Military.[3] The show would take place on the same location as before as the Naval Station had become Brunswick Executive Airport. Despite not being organized by the Military, the United States Navy Blue Angels were still to be featured at the Show after their first appearance in Maine since 2007. The United States Air Force also supported the event with the A-10 Thunderbolt II Demonstration and a USAF Heritage Flight. Civilian aerobatic and warbird performances rounded out the rest of the show. Military Static Displays were canceled due to Hurricane Irene which was moving towards the south. Despite some bad weather, the Show was still an overall success. The next show took place on August 25 and 26, 2012 with an additional night Air Show on August 24, it was headlined by the USAF Thunderbirds and also featured the F/A-18C Hornet Demonstration from the US Navy. The Texas Flying Legends Museum which is based at Wiscasset Airport for part of the year, brought over a restored B-25 Mitchell, P-51D Mustang, P-40 Warhawk, F4U Corsair, and one of only two flyable Mitsubishi A6M Zeros to the Show and participated in a warbird flight that involved mock-aerial combat. The planned 2013 Show was canceled due to Budget Cuts in Congress known as sequestration. The show did not take place in 2014 either because the organizers failed to book a head-lining military act. That year however, the Blue Angels announced their 2015 schedule which included the Great State of Maine Air Show.[4]"

The Frenchman Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) was the first author to describe his work as essays; he used the term to characterize these as ""attempts"" to put his thoughts into writing."

"Saadi Youssef studied Arabic literature in Baghdad.[2] He was influenced by the free verse of Shathel Taqa and Abd al-Wahhab Al-Bayyati and was also involved in politics from an early age. At that time, his work was heavily influenced by his socialist and pan-Arab sympathies but has since also taken a more introspective, lyrical turn. He has also translated many well-known writers into Arabic, including Oktay Rifat, Melih Cevdet Anday, Garcia Lorca, Yiannis Ritsos, Walt Whitman and Constantine Cavafy. Following his exile from Iraq, Youssef has lived in many countries, including Algeria, Lebanon, France, Greece, Cyprus, and resided in London until his death.[4]"
