## Motivation
AI-generated text is increasingly used in academic and professional settings. 
While many detection systems exist, their robustness under real-world text 
transformations remains underexplored.

## Objective
This project evaluates how deep-learning-based AI-text detectors perform when 
AI-generated text is paraphrased, translated, or summarized.

## Research Question
How robust are AI-text detection models under common text transformations?
